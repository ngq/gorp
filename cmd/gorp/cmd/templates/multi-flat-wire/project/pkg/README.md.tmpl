# pkg

`pkg/` is reserved for stable helpers shared by multiple services in this project.

Use this directory only when code is:

- reused by at least two services
- independent from a single service's business semantics
- stable enough to be treated as a project-level contract

Do not put service-specific business logic, HTTP middleware wiring, or infrastructure SDK initialization here. Keep those in each service's `internal/` tree or use the framework application / capability entry points.
